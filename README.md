# Pokemon League

The Pokemon League is a sports scoring app for pokefans to keep track of their favourite trainer. Fans can follow a trainer's journey by adding or removing fixtures and trainers to keep everything up to date.

This app was made as a solo project for the CodeClan course using Ruby for front-end with a Sinatra web framework and PostgreSQL for the database.
